Collecting my web learnings here.

### Installation.

* Getting styled components with nextjs needs some work to do. 
* Added `_document.tsx` and pasted some code from the styled-components example.
* Added `_app.tsx` and included `GlobalStyles` and default theme in the `ThemeProvider`.
* So, the global styles now reside in `styles/global.tsx` and theme resides in `styles/theme.tsx`.
* Hopefully things work.
